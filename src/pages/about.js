        One Nation - One Funding...
      </h1>
      <h3> An HEI needs funds to support its two primary missions  education and research (the third mission of directl
      y contributing to society through innovation and entrepreneurship and outreach, which has also become quite 
      important, often generate resources to support it.) Though of course an HEI has one balance sheet, it is 
      important to separate the funding needs for the two functions, as well as support for these, as these missions
       have different goals and different revenue sources.<br></br>
       <br></br>
       
<br></br>The OE also envisages that funding for education and research is provided separately by different agencies. It 
envisages that there will be a higher education grants council (HEGC) which will provide the base funding to the 
universities. Its role will be to provide financial support for education and running the university, but not for 
research. The research funding is envisaged to come from the national research foundation.<br></br>

     <br></br>
Higher education, of course, is a mission of all HEIs. Higher education is still a people-based service. 
It is largely provided by highly educated and talented faculty, who are supported by teaching assistants, 
lab staff, instructors, etc., who are also skilled personnel. Further support is provided by administrators and 
other specialized staff involved in managing education, other functions, and the infrastructure of the university. 
The role of machinery, which is the main method of reducing costs in commercial production, is very limited in 
higher education. The costs of skilled human resources continue to increase faster than other costs, leading to an
 increase in the cost of university education globally, often at a pace faster than inflation. <br></br>
 <br></br>
  
<br></br>
The main sources of income for a public university are grants from the government, tuition, and other fees. A 
university also gets sponsored research projects these are largely to support research projects and these funds
 are to be used for the research project only, and generally cannot be used for salaries of faculty or the general 
 infrastructure of the university. Hence, for education, government grants and tuition are the main sources of 
 funds.<br></br>
 <br></br>

The portion of the education cost that is provided by the Government  is the higher education subsidy. The rest
 of the cost of education is to be borne by students through the tuition fee.
As the cost of education is effectively covered through the tuition fee paid by a student and the subsidy provided
 by the government for education, generally in the form of yearly grants, the tuition fee has to increase with the
  decrease in subsidy. How much of the cost of education for a public institution should be provided by the 
  government  and how much of it should come from tuition fees is a matter of balance and depends on 
  how the public views HE. The OE is silent on the level of fee that should be charged in public institutions, 
  though it does suggest that the private universities will be free to charge reasonable fees determined in a 
  transparent manner and within some limits. For a private university, the subsidy is nil for the recurring costs
   , and may even be negative in that education may provide a “profit” which may then be used for covering other 
   costs of the HEI  e.g. supporting research or infrastructure.<br></br>
<br></br>

What should the government support be for an HEI for education, which will presumably come from the higher 
education grants council The yearly support provided for education is essential to provide subsidies for 
education. The HEGC support and the fees collected should cover the salaries of all staff and expenses for the
 regular running of the institute. This can form the base funding for an Institution  through which it can 
 comfortably discharge its primary function of education. How much funding the HEGC provides for subsidy and how 
 much of the cost is recovered as tuition will probably depend on the nature and location of institutions, and 
 presumably, there will be policies for the same.<br></br>
